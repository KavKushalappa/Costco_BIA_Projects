# Stakeholder Analysis Using Stock Performance Data

## Objective
Analyze stock performance data to understand how different stakeholder groups interpret the same dataset and how BI can support consistent, evidence-based conversations.

## Dataset
Publicly available stock price and return data used for academic analysis.

## What the assignment involved
IIn this assignment, I analyzed stock performance data to understand how different stakeholder groups might interpret the same underlying dataset differently. The analysis focused on summarizing trends, measuring variability and risk, comparing time periods, and identifying statistically meaningful differences in performance metrics. The goal was not just to compute statistics, but to interpret results through the lens of stakeholder priorities.

## Costco BI use case (hypothetical but realistic)

## Problem 
At Costco, stock performance and financial metrics are often discussed across multiple stakeholder groups—Finance, Executive Leadership, Operations, and Long-Term Investors. While all teams rely on the same underlying stock and financial data, their interpretations can differ based on focus:
Finance may prioritize volatility, downside risk, and stability
Leadership may focus on long-term growth and consistency
Operations may care about how market performance reflects execution and efficiency
Without a structured analytical view, conversations can become fragmented, with each group emphasizing different metrics from the same dataset.

## How this analysis would help: 
A stakeholder-focused stock data analysis like this could be used to:
Compare how different performance measures (returns, volatility, moving averages, drawdowns) support different stakeholder perspectives
Quantify trade-offs between short-term fluctuations and long-term stability using statistical summaries
Provide a single, shared analytical foundation for discussions about performance rather than subjective interpretation

## Business impact:
Creates a shared, data-backed narrative across teams
Reduces ambiguity in cross-functional discussions by clarifying what each metric representsHelps BI teams facilitate clearer conversations between business leaders using consistent metrics

## Why this matters at Costco: 
Costco’s business and investor philosophy emphasizes long-term value, stability, and trust over short-term volatility. A stakeholder-driven analysis of stock data helps ensure that performance discussions remain aligned with those principles and that decisions are informed by context rather than isolated metrics.
