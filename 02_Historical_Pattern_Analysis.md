## Background
This case study is based on a statistics assignment that examined HOLC-style historical classification data to understand how past decisions can continue to shape present-day outcomes. The assignment focused less on prediction and more on interpretation—specifically, how historical context, structural patterns, and bias can influence what we see in current data.

A key takeaway from this work was that data often carries legacy effects. Without acknowledging those effects, there is a risk of misinterpreting current performance or attributing outcomes to the wrong causes.

## Objective
To analyze historically classified data and demonstrate how Business Intelligence teams can help separate legacy-driven patterns from current performance, enabling more informed and fair decision-making.

## Data Used
The analysis used HOLC-style historical classification data combined with present-day outcome measures. While the dataset itself was academic, it mirrors real-world scenarios where historical categorizations or decisions continue to influence modern metrics.

## What the assignment involved
This assignment focused on analyzing HOLC-style data to understand how historical classifications influenced long-term outcomes. The emphasis was on uncovering structural patterns, evaluating bias or imbalance, and interpreting results in context rather than treating the data as neutral.

## Costco BI use case (adapted to retail context)

## Problem: 
Costco works with long-term membership data, pricing strategies, and regional performance. Historical decisions—such as warehouse placement, assortment strategies, or membership pricing—can continue to influence current performance.

## How this analysis would help: A similar analytical approach could be applied to:
Examine how historical membership acquisition strategies affect present-day renewal rates
Identify whether earlier operational decisions still shape performance across regions or member segments
Assess whether certain groups or regions are systematically underperforming due to legacy factors rather than current execution

## Business impact:
Helps leadership separate historical inertia from current performance issues
Prevents misattribution of underperformance to the wrong causes
Supports fairer, more informed decision-making when revisiting legacy strategies

## Why this matters at Costco: 
Costco values long-term thinking. Understanding how past decisions affect present outcomes helps BI teams guide strategy without overcorrecting based on short-term signals.

## Key Takeaway
This assignment reinforced that good analytics is not just about calculation, but about interpretation and communication. BI teams add value by helping stakeholders understand what the data is actually saying, what it is not saying, and how decisions can be made with greater clarity.
