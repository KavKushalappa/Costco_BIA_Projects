# Predictive Modeling & Classification

## Background
This case study is based on a set of machine learning assignments where the goal was to use predictive models to support decision-making, not to build the most complex or highest-accuracy solution. The emphasis throughout the work was on understanding trade-offs, evaluating model behavior, and determining whether a model’s output could realistically be used by a business team.

Rather than treating prediction as an end in itself, the assignments focused on how models inform prioritization and where human judgment still matters.

## Objective
To use predictive modeling and classification techniques to support prioritization decisions while balancing accuracy, interpretability, and business risk.

## Data Used
The assignments used structured datasets with a defined outcome variable and multiple explanatory features. The data allowed for classification tasks, probability estimation, and evaluation across different thresholds and performance metrics.

## Predictive Modeling & Classification

What the assignment involved
In my ML coursework, I worked with real datasets to build predictive and classification models. The focus was not just on accuracy, but on evaluating trade-offs (false positives vs. false negatives), interpretability, and whether a model’s output could realistically support a business decision.
Costco BI / Analytics use case

## Problem: 
Costco BI teams often need to prioritize action—deciding where to intervene, which members to focus on, or which processes require attention—without overcomplicating decision-making.

## How this analysis would help: ML-style analyses could be used to:
Flag members at higher risk of non-renewal so retention efforts are better targeted
Identify warehouses or categories likely to experience demand volatility
Support prioritization decisions rather than automate them blindly

## Business impact:
Enables proactive decision-making
Improves resource allocation without replacing human judgment
Keeps analytics aligned with Costco’s preference for explainable, practical insights

## Why this matters at Costco: 
Costco’s analytics culture favors clarity and trust over black-box models. ML work that emphasizes interpretability fits that philosophy well.
